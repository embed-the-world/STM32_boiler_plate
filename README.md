# STM32 quick start

Using HAL library by STMicroelectronics.

Meant for a quick start in tinkering.

The version is tested for STM32F411CEU on a black pill board.
A stepper motor controller is added with pulse pin on GPIO A7.
Right now the stepper motor is implemented blocking the code.
This will change in the future.

## usage
the top level makefile has everything covered.
A simple "make" or "make all" will clean the repo, compile everything and flash it.

Furthermore the following targets are available:
- clean,
- compile,
- flash,
- test (tbd)

New source files must be added to the Makefile in external/configCubeMx.
This Makefile is auomatically generated by STM32CubeMx.

## tooling

tools used:
- arm-none-eabi-gcc
- st-flash
- gnu make

these tools are not optional!
